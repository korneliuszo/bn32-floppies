Press these keys to enter alphabetic characters, numeric characters and symbols.

Some typewriter keys also serve as numeric keys like a calculator.  On the front of these keys, gray lettering indicates an alternative key value.

Before using the numeric keys, set the NumLk lamp on.  Press the numeric keys to enter numbers or to do computations.

(The NumLk lamp toggles on and off each time you press NumLk/ScrLk while holding down Shift.)

If you enter numbers frequently, the use of an optional 10-key keypad is recommended.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

<Function Keys>
USA Keyboard

The functions of these keys vary according to the status of the ScrLk lamp.

When the ScrLk lamp is on, the screen scrolls in the direction of the arrow key you press (Some application programs do not support scrolling).  See the User’s Manual of your application program.

When the ScrLk lamp is off, the cursor moves in the direction of the arrow key you press.

The ScrLk lamp toggles on and off each time you press NumLk/ScrLk.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

<Caps Lock Key>
USA Keyboard
5

The CpsLk lamp toggles on and off each time you press Caps Lock.

When the CpsLk lamp is on, all alphabetic characters are entered as upper-case (capital) letters, and using Shift lets you enter lower-case letters.

When the CpsLk lamp is off, all alphabetic characters are entered as lower-case letters and using Shift lets you enter capital letters.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

<Alt Key>
USA Keyboard
5

Hold down this key and press a second key to perform the "alternate" function for the second key.

The alternate function is indicated in green on the keyboard in front of each key (such as the SysRq function).

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

<Shift Key>
USA Keyboard
5

Use this key to enter capital letters, as you would with a typewriter.  When the CpsLk lamp is off, all alphabetic characters you enter while holding down Shift are capital letters.

Hold down Shift to enter the upper character of the keys such as ! or # or %.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

<Special Keys>
USA Keyboard
5

Special keys include Enter used to enter data into the computer and Esc to stop the current operation.  For more details about these keys, see the manual of your application program.

{2_012.gif}

\bThe main power switch turns the computer on and off.\b

Each time the main power switch is turned on, the computer starts the MS-DOS system and then displays the initial screen for Windows.

Turn the computer on and off with the main power switch in the following occasions:  

• When you turn on the computer for the first time

• When you do not expect to use the computer for a long time

• When you clean the computer

• Before you connect optional equipment

{2_013.gif}

\bTo turn the computer on...\b

Slide the main power switch on the back of the computer toward the ON symbol.

The Resume lamp turns on.  

{2_014.gif}

\bTo turn the computer off...\b

Slide the main power switch on the back of the computer toward the Standby symbol.  The computer turns off in approximately 1 to 7 seconds. 

Make sure both the Hard Disk lamp and the Floppy lamp are off when you turn the main power switch off.

The Resume lamp turns off.

{2_015.gif}

\bWait for at least 10 seconds after turning the computer off before moving it.\b

The internal hard disk may not finish spinning for a few moments after the computer is turned off.  Moving the computer while the hard disk drive is still operating may damage the hard disk drive.

When you turn the main power off, the print head is automatically covered to prevent ink from drying out in the nozzle tip.  If you move the computer immediately after turning the power off, the cap may not yet have covered the print head.  Wait at least for 10 seconds after turning the computer off.  

{2_016.gif}

\bThe computer caps the print head to preserve the ink supply when the main 
power switch is turned off.\b

Your printer uses the Bubble Jet printing technology, which means that the printer operates by ejecting ink from the print head.  The capping function covers the print head to prevent ink from drying out in the nozzle tip.  The cap automatically covers the print head in the following cases:

• When the main power switch or the Printer switch has been turned on, and printer initialization is complete

• Approximately 5 seconds after printing is complete

• When the computer goes into the Suspended Mode

• When the Printer switch is turned off

• When the main power switch is turned off

{2_017.gif}

\bTo turn the printer on...\b

Slide the Printer switch to the word "On".  The printer On/Off switch is separate from the computer's power switch.

When you turn on the printer, the print head/ink cartridge assembly moves, the printer is initialized and ready to use.  This initialization procedure is repeated each time the Printer switch is turned on when the main power switch is on.

{2_018.gif}

\bTo turn the printer off... \b

Slide the Printer switch to the word "Off".  Turn the printer off if you do not plan to use it.  Also turn the printer off in the following cases:

• When you want to reset the printer

• When you want to cancel printing immediately

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[The Suspend/Resume Switch]
Turning the Computer On and Off
6
{2_019.gif}

\bUse the Suspend/Resume switch to put the computer into the Suspended Mode.\b

Use the Suspend/Resume switch in the following occasions:

• When you pause the computer

• Before charging the battery pack

When you slide the Suspend/Resume switch for more than 1 second to turn the computer off, the computer goes into the Suspended Mode.  To leave the Suspended Mode, slide the Suspend/Resume switch again.

In the Suspended Mode, the computer appears to be turned off but the memory continues to be powered by AC power or the battery.  The last screen display is stored into memory before it is turned off.  When you slide the Suspend/Resume switch again to turn the computer on, the screen appears just as it did before the computer was turned off.  This feature saves you time when you want to start work where you left off.  For more information, see |Suspended Mode|Suspended Mode|.

{2_019.gif}

\bTo put the computer into the Suspended Mode...\b

To enter the Suspended Mode, slide the Suspend/Resume switch to the right for more than 1 second while leaving the main power switch on, and then release it.  Make sure both the Hard Disk lamp and the Floppy lamp are off when you slide the Suspend/Resume switch.

Upon the operation of the Suspend/Resume switch, you hear a single beep.  In approximately 1 to 10 seconds, the screen display disappears and the computer goes into the Suspended Mode.  The Resume lamp also goes off.  Please note that the printer also goes into the Suspended Mode.  

{2_021.gif}

\bTo leave the Suspended Mode...\b

Slide the Suspend/Resume switch to the right for more than 1 second again, and then release it.  

The Hard Disk lamp blinks several times, indicating that the hard disk is being accessed.  After a moment, you hear a single beep, the Resume lamp lights up and the screen appears just as it was before the computer went into the Suspended Mode.  Both the computer and the printer resume operation.  

{2_022.gif}

\bSliding the Suspend/Resume switch during printing\b

If you activate the Suspend/Resume switch during printing, the printer interrupts the print job and the computer goes into the Suspended Mode within approximately 6 seconds.  When you slide the Suspend/Resume switch again, the computer comes out of the Suspended Mode and resumes printing.

{2_023.gif}

\bDo not leave the computer in the Suspended Mode long to avoid the battery drain.\b

In the Suspended Mode, the computer uses little energy to store the last screen display into memory.  If you leave the computer in the Suspended Mode for more than 4 days with a fully charged battery pack, the battery may be drained and the data yet to be saved in the hard disk (or a floppy disk) will be lost.  So, when you are not using the AC adapter, frequently save the data on the hard disk.

{2_024.gif}

\bWait for at least 10 seconds after sliding the Suspend/Resume switch to go into the Suspended Mode before moving the computer.\b

The internal hard disk may not yet finish spinning for a few moments after the Suspend/Resume switch is activated.  Moving the computer while the hard disk drive is still operating may damage the hard disk drive.  In addition, if you move the computer immediately after sliding the Suspend/Resume switch, the cap may not cover the print head yet.

[Using the Lid]
Turning the Computer On and Off
6
{2_026.gif}

\bYou can put the computer into the Suspended Mode when you close the lid.\b

Closing the computer lid has the same effect as using the Suspend/Resume switch to activate the Suspended Mode.  When you open the lid again, the computer leaves the Suspended Mode, and the screen display appears as it did just before closing the lid. 

\bNote:\b  With the default setting of the Setup Utility, the computer automatically goes into the Suspended Mode when you close the lid.  However, if the Power Control option in the Setup Utility is set to disable the Suspended Mode, the computer does not enter the Suspended Mode when the lid is closed.  

{2_027.gif}

\bWait for at least 10 seconds after closing the lid before moving the computer.\b

The internal hard disk may not finish spinning for a few moments after the lid is closed.  Moving the computer while the hard disk drive is still operating may damage the hard disk drive.  

The computer automatically caps the print head when the main power is turned off so if you move the computer immediately after closing the lid, the cap may not cover the print head yet.

[Using the TrackPoint II]
Getting Started
6
{2_030.gif}

\bUnlike a mouse, the TrackPoint II can be used virtually anywhere without a flat surface.\b

You can use the TrackPoint II with your fingers put on the keyboard.  This enables you to operate the computer more smoothly. 

\bNotes:\b  
• The TrackPoint II can be used in Windows.  If you use it in MS-DOS, 
see |Troubleshooting|The Keyboard... Problems|.
• If the Pointing Device setting in the Easy-Setup is set to disable the TrackPoint II, the TrackPoint II does not work.  Change the setting when using the TrackPoint II.
See |Setup-2|Setup-2| of |the Easy-Setup|The Easy-Setup|.

{2_031.gif}

\bYou can use the mouse with the TrackPoint II.\b

\bNote:\b  The RS-232C mouse cannot use with the computer.  Use the PS/2-compatible mouse.  In addition, depending on the type of the PS/2-compatible mouse, you may not be able to use it with the TrackPoint II.  Should this happen, change the setting of the Pointing Device in the Easy-Setup to disable the TrackPoint II.  
See |Setup-2|Setup-2| of |the Easy-Setup|The Easy-Setup|.

{2_032.hsp}
{2_032.gif}

\bPut your finger on the TrackPoint II as shown.\b

Place the left thumb on the left button, the right thumb on the right button and the index finger on the TrackPoint II.

Keep pressing the TrackPoint II to move the pointer in the same direction (The more you press the mouse, the faster the pointer moves).  Move it up, down, left or right to position the pointer to the location you want on the screen.

{2_033.gif}

\bThe left and right buttons correspond to mouse buttons.\b

The left and right buttons below the space bar have the same functions as the left and right buttons of the mouse.

{2_034.gif}

\bClicking\b

Pressing and releasing either button is called "Clicking".  Click the left button to make selections in Windows.

{2_035.gif}

\bDouble-clicking\b

Pressing and releasing either button twice quickly is called "Double-clicking".  Double-click to open and close windows when using Windows.

[Types of Disks]
Using Floppy Disks
6
{2_038.gif}

\bThe computer uses two different types of 3.5-inch floppy disks.\b

The basic difference between the two types of floppy disks is the amount of storage.

{2_040.hsp}
{2_040.gif}

\bThe computer can use 3.5-inch 2HD (double-sided, high-density) floppy disks.\b

This type of floppy disk holds up to 1.44 Mbytes of data.  This amount of storage is twice that of the 2DD type.

The 2HD disks have a small hole on the lower right-hand corner of the disk cover.  It may also have the initials HD on it.

{2_041.gif}

\bThe computer can also use 3.5-inch 2DD (double-sided, double-density) floppy disks.\b

This type holds up to 720 Kbytes of data.  The disks do not have a hole on the lower right-hand corner of the disk cover.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Initializing Disks]
Using Floppy Disks
5

\bYou must initialize a floppy disk before you use it.\b

In order to read and write data to and from a floppy disk, the computer must first decide on a method for writing the data, divide the floppy disk into address sectors, and create a place to record and control what data gets written at what address on the disks.  This operation is called formatting (or initializing).

Because different types of computers use different methods for writing on disks, you have to format new disks so that the computer can use them.  

The formatting process creates a new method of recording for your disk, which erases all previous information on the disk.  Before you format a disk, you must be certain that it is a new disk, or that any data it contains can be deleted.

For more information on formatting, refer to "Microsoft Windows & MS-DOS 6 User's Guide".  

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Handling Disks]
Using Floppy Disks
6
{2_038.gif}

\bFloppy disks are convenient for storing data but handle them properly.\b

The data on floppy disks is written with magnetic fields.  Improper handling may damage or lose precious data.  Observe the following precautions when you use floppy disks:

{2_043.gif}

\bNever place the disk near a magnetic field.\b

Never place floppy disks near magnets, television sets, speakers and the other sources of magnetic fields.  Magnetic fields may damage or even erase the data on floppy disks.

{2_044.gif}

\bAvoid high temperatures and direct sunlight.\b

Do not expose floppy disks to high temperatures or excessive humidity, and do not place them in direct sunlight.  Be sure to keep them within the range between 32 °F and 127 °F  (0 °C to 53 °C).

{2_045.hsp}
{2_045.gif}

\bNever touch the disk surface or hub of the floppy disk.\b

When you open the floppy disk shutter, a magnetic recording surface is visible.  Do not touch this surface with your fingers, and do not expose it to dust.  The disk may become unusable.  Touching the floppy disk hub may also cause disk failure.

{2_046.gif}

\bDo not mistreat floppy disks.\b

Do not drop floppy disks or place heavy objects on the top of them.  Also avoid bending floppy disks and mistreating them in general.  Get into the habit of placing disks in their protective plastic case and store them in a vertical position when not in use.

{2_047.gif}

\bNever use floppy disks that have liquids, eraser crumbs, or other dirt on them.\b

Using disks that have foreign substances on them may damage the floppy disks.  Never use disks that are in this condition.

{2_038.gif}

\bMake backup disks storing valuable data.\b

No floppy disk can be guaranteed against failure.  It is a good idea to store a copy of your valuable data on a backup floppy disk as well as the original floppy disk.

Backup means making a copy of the original file, in case the disk is damaged or unusable.  

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Write-Protection]
Using Floppy Disks
6
{2_049.hsp}
{2_049.gif}

\b What is write-protection?\b

Floppy disks have a write-protect tab that prevents data from being erased accidentally.
You cannot change the data on a write-protected floppy disk in any way.  If the disk is write-protected, you cannot:

• Delete or change current data

• Save new data on the disk

• Initialize the disk

New floppy disks are write-enabled so you can initialize and write data to the disk.  Switch the floppy disk between write-protected and write-enabled by switching the write-protect tab.

{2_050.gif}

\bTo write-protect a floppy disk...\b

Move the write-protect tab down as illustrated, leaving the slot open.

The disk is now write-protected.

{2_051.gif}

\bTo write-enable a disk...\b

Move the write-protect tab up as illustrated, covering the slot.

The disk is now write-enabled.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Inserting and Ejecting a Disk]
Using Floppy Disks
6
{2_052.gif}

\bTo insert a floppy disk...\b

As shown in the illustration, gently push the floppy disk into the floppy disk drive with a label side up.  When the disk is fully inserted, the floppy disk eject button pops out.

{2_053.hsp}
{2_053.gif}

\bTo remove a floppy disk...\b

Make sure the Floppy lamp is not on, then press the floppy disk eject button.  The floppy disk is ejected from the computer.

\bNote:\b  If the Floppy lamp is on, the computer is accessing the floppy disk.  Ejecting the disk during the access may damage the data on the disk.

[Cautions about the Types of Paper]
Paper: Regular and Special
5

\bUse these types of paper:\b

	Regular good quality paper

	Letter-size or A4-size  paper

	Paper up to a maximum size of 8.5 x 14 inches (215.9 mm x 355.6 mm)

	Paper down to a minimum size of 7.2 x 7.2 inches (182 mm x 182 mm)

\bDo not use these types of paper:\b

Avoid using the following types of paper since they may not give you satisfactory print quality, and may even cause paper jams:

	Folded or crumpled paper

	Hole-punched paper

	Wet or moist paper

	Continuous-fold paper 
	(paper with small round guide holes on either side, and perforations between pages).

\bUse of OHP transparency with BJ printers.\b

Do not use transparencies designed for plain paper copiers.  They do not absorb ink so they may stain the feed rollers and sometimes stain your fingers.  For information on usable types of OHP transparency, see |Printer Supplies|Printer supplies|.

\bCautions about OHP transparencies\b

OHP transparencies are sensitive to temperature and humidity.  When printing on OHP transparencies, always make sure that the temperature and humidity are within the following range:

	Temperature: 59º F and 86º F (15º C and 30º C) 
	Humidity: 20% to 70% (Be careful about condensation within the limits.)

\bAfter printing on OHP transparencies, be sure to clean the printer roller.\b

When you print on OHP transparencies, some of the ink is transferred to the feed rollers.  Clean the rollers immediately after you finish printing.

\bCompatibility Differences\b

The built-in printer controller emulates the IBM Proprinter X24E and the EPSON LQ-510.  However, some operations and functions are not compatible because of hardware differences such as the printing mechanism and the print head structure.  Read this part carefully if you need to make common printer driver programs for the X24E/BJ-10e or LQ-510.

\bNote:\b Due to hardware differences, the reverse feed code (ESC ]) is not supported by the built-in printer.

\bNote:\b Due to hardware differences, the justification code (ESC a) and the reverse page feed code (ESC j) are not supported by the built-in printer.

This appendix lists the control codes and ESCape sequences you can use in the X24E or BJ-130e Emulation and LQ-510 Emulation.  For a complete description of these programming commands, you can order the \iCanon X24E/BJ-130e Emulation User's Guide\i or the \iCanon LQ-510 Emulation User's Guide\i.  See |Support Center List|Support Center List| for your reference.

The control codes and ESCape sequences tell the printer how to print a job.  You send commands to the printer in one of the two ways:

You can use your application software to automatically embed certain commands (such as bold, underline or indent) within a document.  When the document prints, the embedded commands control the way the printer produces the printed page.  Refer to your application software manual for instructions on sending commands.

You can send specific commands directly to the printer, using either a BASIC programming statement or a printer command option in your software.

\bX24E and BJ-130e emulations\b

In the X24E and BJ-130e emulations, your printer supports five IBM code pages: USA code page 437, Multilingual code page 850, Portuguese code page 860, Canadian-French code page 863 and Norwegian code page 865.  The USA and Multilingual code pages have three character sets: Character Set 1, Character Set 2 and All-characters Chart.

To select the code page, use the Setup Utility.  If you want to run the Setup Utility now click |here|!run c:\canon\others\bnprset.exe|.

Each code page corresponds to the All-characters Chart.  With the All-characters Chart, there are no control codes except the space code at ASCII 32.  All the other ASCII characters are printable.  The All-characters Chart is selected by the ESC ^ or the ESC \\ code.

The Character Set 1 has control codes in two places: one between ASCII 0 and ASCII 32, and the other between ASCII 128 and ASCII 159.  The Character Set 2 has control codes between ASCII 0 and 32.  All the other ASCII characters are printable.

To see these character sets, select the appropriate topic below.  To exit the character set screen when you finish viewing the characters, simply close the window.

\bLQ-510 emulation\b

In the LQ-510 emulation, two character sets are defined: the italics set and the graphics set.  However, a portion of each of these sets is governed by a country setting, allowing it to print special characters used in particular countries.  These special characters, as a group, are called the international characters.

Use Setup Utility to select the LQ-510 emulation character set.  Choose the italics and graphics character sets from the Setup Utility as well as the country setting for international characters.  If you want to run the Setup Utility now click |here|!run c:\canon\others\bnprset.exe|.

In the LQ-510 emulation, your printer can access the following character sets:

	|Epson Italics|!img 3_073.gif|
	|Epson Graphics|!img 3_074.gif|
	|Epson International|!img 3_075.gif|

By clicking one of these topics, you can see these character sets.  To exit the screen with the character sets, simply close the window.

The Italics character set has control codes in two places: one between the ASCII 0 and ASCII 32, and the other between ASCII 128 and ASCII 159.  In addition, the Italics character set has the italics characters between ASCII A0 and ASCII FF.  All the other characters are printable.  The characters from ASCII 80 to ASCII FF correspond to IBM Character Set 2.

[Where to Place Your Computer]
Computer Care
6
{4_001.gif}

\bChoose a good location.\b

Choose a room for the computer where the temperature is between 50º F and 95º F (10º C and 35º C) and the humidity is between 20% and 80%.  Within these limits be careful to avoid condensation.

Set the computer on a level, vibration-free surface.

{4_002.gif}

\bDo not place the computer in direct sunlight.\b  

If you place the computer near a window or inside a car or take it outside, it may overheat.
If direct sunlight is a problem indoors, place a curtain or shade in the window.

{4_003.gif}

\bDo not expose the computer to moisture or dust.\b

Exposing the computer to mist or dust can cause it to fail.

{4_004.gif}

\bDo not place the computer near strong magnetic fields.\b

The computer uses electronic signals.  If it is too close to magnets, television sets, radios, large electric motors or other sources of strong magnetic fields, the interference may affect the computer's operations.

{4_005.gif}

\bDo not place the computer on sloping surfaces, and do not turn it on its side.\b

When carrying the computer, there are several things you need to keep in mind.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Using Your Computer Safely]
Computer Care

{4_006.gif}

\bDo not put anything on the computer's lid and do not press down on the lid too hard.\b

If you press on the cover too hard, you may crack the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) or damage other parts.

{4_007.gif}

\bDo not shake the computer.\b

If you shake the computer or place it on a sloping surface, especially when it is writing data to a disk, you may damage the disk and other parts of the computer.

{4_008.gif}

\bDo not spill coffee or other liquids on the computer.\b  


A spill could not only damage the computer but it could also shock you.

{4_009.gif}

\bWait for at least 4 seconds after turning the computer off before you turn it on again.\b

If you turn the power switch or the Printer switch on and off rapidly, you could damage the equipment.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[The Ink Cartridge/Print Head]
Computer Care
6
{4_010.gif}

\bDo not open the ink cartridge/print head protective bag until you are ready to install it.\b

This protects the quality of the ink cartridge and print head.

{4_011.gif}

\bUse up the ink cartridge within 6 months after opening the package.\b

A print cartridge that has been unpacked for more than 6 months may not print properly.

{4_012.gif}

\bStore ink cartridges, print heads and head holders out of the reach of children.\b\k

The ink cartridges, print heads, and ink are harmful if swallowed.

{4_013.gif}

\bDo not place ink cartridges or print head in direct sunlight and do not expose them to
high temperatures.\b

Exposure to direct sunlight or high temperatures may affect the printing quality.
Keep the computer and these components away from direct sunlight and high temperatures.

{4_014.gif}

\bDo not tip or drop the ink cartridge.\b

If you tip the ink cartridge, ink may spill out.

{4_015.gif}

\bDo not manually pull the print head from the ink cartridge when you need to replace it.\b

The replacement procedure involves other necessary steps to avoid possible damage to the printer.
Follow the BJcartridge Instructions in the Canon group or the Print Head and Ink Cartridge in the On-line Guide when changing print heads.

{4_016.gif}

\bNever remove the print head/ink cartridge from the computer unless necessary.\b

It may cause deterioration of the print head.  The ink may also spill from the ink cartridge.

{4_017.gif}

\bNever touch the nozzles or electrodes on the print head.\b

Touching the nozzles may clog them and affect print quality.  When setting down the print head, never place the nozzle surface downward.

{4_018.gif}

\bNever refill or repair the ink cartridge.\b

If you try to refill or repair the ink cartridge, you could damage the computer.  

One ink cartridge prints approximately 100,000 alphanumeric characters.  The number of sheets you can print varies according to how much data you print and how frequently you use the printer.

Replace the ink cartridge whenever the print quality remains scratchy or poor after five head cleanings.

The ink used in the BP-30 print head is manufactured by Canon under the strictest quality control standards.  This ink is exclusively formulated for the print head to provide stable printing quality and extend the printer's life. 

For the most reliable printing results, Canon's ink cartridges are recommended.

The use of refilled or third-party cartridges is not recommended for the Canon BJ printers.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Carrying Your Computer]
Computer Care
6
{4_019.gif}

\bAlways carry the computer with the print head and the ink cartridge attached.\b

The print head is capped automatically except when the computer is printing.  Do not remove the print head and the ink cartridge when carrying the computer.

{4_020.gif}

\bAlways wait for 10 seconds after turning the power off, before you move the computer.\b

Turn the main power switch off before moving the computer.  When you turn the power off, it takes a few moments for the hard disk to stop spinning.  Be sure to wait for 10 seconds at least after turning the power off before you move the computer.  If you move the computer while the disk is still spinning, you could damage the disk.

It also takes a few seconds to cap the print head after you turn off the power.

{4_021.gif}

\bAlways carry the computer with the tilt legs folded.\b

Carrying the computer with the tilt legs extended could damage the computer.  Retract the tilt legs before carrying the computer.

Slide the legs toward the back of the computer and press them down to fold them into the computer body.

{4_022.gif}

\bAlways carry the computer with the attached equipment removed.\b

Before carrying the computer, make sure the main power switch is off.  Then, remove all the equipment  such as the paper tray, palm rest or any other optional equipment.

{4_023.gif}

\bAlways handle the computer with care.\b

Do not drop the computer or bang it into things.

{4_029.gif}

If the print looks scratchy or faint, clean the print head.  Cleaning the print head cleans the nozzles and modulates the ink from the nozzles to improve print quality. 

Clean the print head only when print quality is poor.  Unnecessary cleaning of the print head uses up the ink supply.  You can clean the print head automatically by running the print head cleaning program built into the computer, or by conducting the appropriate sequence of buttons manually.  The built-in cleaning program also runs from Windows.  For more information, select one of the following:

{5_001.gif}

\bBattery Pack\b

When the AC adapter is not connected to the computer, it draws power from the battery pack. 

There are two types of battery packs; NiCd (nickel cadmium) battery pack and the NiMH (nickel metal hydride) battery pack.  

\bNiCd Battery Pack\b

The computer comes with the NiCd battery pack.

When shipped from the factory, the battery pack is not charged.  Be sure to charge the battery pack before using the computer.

Your NiCd battery pack has an operating lifetime of approximately 500 charges and discharges.

{5_002.gif}

\bNiMH Battery Pack (Optional)\b

The optional NiMH battery pack has larger charge capacity than the NiCd battery pack.

The NiMH battery pack has larger charge capacity than the NiCd battery pack, so it operates longer.

Your battery pack has an operating lifetime of approximately 500 charges and discharges.

Charging the Battery Pack
6
{5_003.hsp}
{5_003.gif}

\bRemaining power in the battery pack\b

The color of the Battery lamp tells you how much power remains in the battery pack.

Charge the battery pack when the Battery lamp is \morange\k.
Be particularly careful to save data immediately when the Battery lamp turns to \morange\k.

{5_004.gif}

\bIf you want to continue working, use the AC adapter.\b

If you want to continue your work when the Battery lamp is \morange\k, connect the AC adapter to the computer.  After your work is finished, be sure to save the data and charge the battery.

{5_003.hsp}
{5_003.gif}

\bPower continues to drop...\b

When the Battery lamp is \morange\k and blinking, the battery pack has almost no power and the power supply will stop within 10 minutes.

If the Battery lamp is \morange\k and blinking, charge your battery pack at once or replace the battery pack with a fully charged one.

{2_016.gif}

\bPower is almost gone...\b

In approximately 30 seconds after the Resume lamp starts blinking, the computer automatically enters the Suspended Mode.

Always save the data before you charge the battery.

If you are preparing data, always save the data before you charge the battery.  If the power supply stops before you save the data to the hard disk, the data will be lost.  In addition, the resume function works improperly.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Battery Life]
Charging the Battery Pack
5

The length of time you can use the battery and the time required to charge it (from the time the Battery lamp is \morange\k to full charge) depend on the type of your battery pack and the environment under which it is used.

				\bAverage Active Time\b	\bCharge Time\b

	\bNiCd Battery Pack\b	approx. 180 minutes	approx. 70 minutes

	\bNiMH Battery Pack\b	approx. 200 minutes	approx. 90 minutes

Even under the same operating conditions, actual charge time may vary according to the temperature and the condition of the battery pack.  The time shown should be taken as a guideline only.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Suspended Mode]
Charging the Battery Pack
5

To put the computer in the Suspended Mode, slide the Suspend/Resume switch to the right for more than 1 second.  To exit the computer from the Suspended Mode, slide the Suspend/Resume switch again.  For more information, see |Suspend/Resume Switch|Suspend/Resume Switch|.

In the Suspended Mode, the computer is turned off, but stores the screen data using battery power.

The Suspended Mode uses battery power regardless of the use of the computer.

In the Suspended Mode, the computer remembers the screen as it was before you slid the Suspend/Resume switch.  Therefore, when the computer is in the Suspended Mode but not connected to the AC adapter, the power from the battery pack is used.

Beginning with a fully charged battery pack, the computer stores information in the Suspended Mode for about 4 days.

When you use the computer to create data without the AC adapter, you should get into the habit of saving data frequently.  Always be sure you save the data before you interrupt your work or leave the computer for a few moments.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[The Memory Effect]
Charging the Battery Pack
5

If you repeatedly charge a battery pack after only a little of its energy has been used, its maximum charge capacity gradually gets smaller.  This is called the "memory effect", reducing the lifetime of the battery.

The memory effect could occur in the following occasions:

You have been working outside and used the battery a little.  
Then you come back inside, connect the AC adapter and start working again.  
You slide the Suspend/Resume switch (or close the lid) to enter the Suspended Mode for a long time.

When you leave the computer in the Suspended Mode with the AC adapter plugged in, the Charge lamp will come on and the battery will begin charging.  This is the same as using a little energy of the battery and then charging it a little.

To avoid the memory effect, observe the following precautions to use the battery as long as possible:

• Start charging only after the Battery lamp has turned \morange\k.  Do not charge the battery when the Battery lamp is \ggreen\k or \yyellow\k.

• When the power is supplied by the battery pack, use the battery pack until the Battery lamp turns \morange\k.  Do not connect the AC adapter until the Battery lamp has turned \morange\k.

If the memory effect occurs, you can restore the battery to its original capacity by discharging the remaining energy completely first, and then charging the battery fully.

The type of plug differs from country to country.

{5_009.gif}

When the Charge lamp comes on, charging begins.

While the battery pack is charged, the Charge lamp comes on and the Battery lamp is \yyellow\k.  Only when an error is indicated, turn the main power switch off or disconnect the battery pack. 
When charging is complete, the Charge lamp goes off and the Battery lamp turns \ggreen\k.

The charge time depends on the type of the battery you have:
The NiCd battery will charge in approximately 70 minutes and the NiMH in approximately 90 minutes.

If a problem occurs during charging, the Charge lamp blinks or the Battery lamp blinks in \morange\k.  See |Panel Lamp Messages|Panel Lamp Messages|.

\bWarning:  Be careful when disposing of a battery pack.\b

Never dispose of the battery pack by incineration, or try to disassemble and reconstruct it.  Your NiCd battery pack contains materials such as cadmium that can be harmful to the environment, so it must not be placed with normal refuse.  Be sure to observe all local regulations regarding the locations and methods of disposing of the batteries.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Conserving Battery Power]
Computer Power

You can operate the computer from the battery pack for a long period of time if you use power properly.  The computer has the power-saving function; if no operations occur within a set period of time, the power-saving function works automatically.

You can set the period of time required before the computer goes into the power-saving mode by using the Setup Utility.  For a description of the Power Saving Mode and setting instructions, see |Setup Utilities|Setup Utilities|.

Remove the battery pack if you do not plan to use the computer for a while.

Even with the main power switch off, the battery pack loses a little energy.  Remove the battery pack if you do not use the computer for a long time.

The battery pack gradually discharges even when removed from the computer.  This discharge occurs more rapidly at higher temperatures, so keep the battery pack in a cool location when not in use.  The battery pack stored for a long time, even if it is fully charged initially, loses some of power.  Its full capacity restores by fully charging and discharging several times.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[In Case of a Power Failure]
Computer Power
5

If a central power failure occurs while you are using the AC adapter, the computer is automatically powered by the battery pack.  Use the computer in accordance with the guidelines about the use of the battery pack.

When the power failure is over, the AC adapter starts to power the computer automatically.

If the battery capacity is exhausted, there is a possibility that a power failure while you are using the AC adapter may cause you to lose power or lose data stored in the computer memory.

If a power failure occurs when the battery capacity is exhausted, take the following steps:

1.  Turn the main power switch off.
2.  Disconnect the AC adapter from the power outlet.
3.  Wait until the power failure is over and the central power is restored. 
4.  Reconnect the AC adapter and turn the main power switch on (This avoids a power surge that may damage the computer).
5.  When power is restored, check the following:
	• Is the initial screen correctly displayed?
	• Is the data stored on the disks retained?

Be aware of the possibility of losing data stored in memory.  You should get into the habit of saving the data frequently.  In particular, always make sure that you save the data before you interrupt your work or leave the computer for a few moments.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Extreme Conditions]
Computer Power
5

Be aware of the following caution when using your battery pack in cold conditions.

When a battery pack has been chilled and then brought into a warm room to be charged, it may stop charging even though it does not reach the full capacity yet.  This is typically characteristic of the optional NiMH battery.

If the battery pack is colder than the room temperature, keep it in the room until it reaches the room temperature before charging. 

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Sub-Battery]
Computer Power
5

When the computer is not connected to either the AC adapter or the battery pack, the sub-battery supplies power temporarily.  The battery operates when you change the battery pack while the computer is not connected to the AC adapter.  Note that the backup battery can only provide power for a maximum of 10 minutes when fully charged.  If you replace the battery pack without using the AC adapter, be sure to insert the new battery pack within 10 minutes.  The sub-battery is built in the computer and is not removable.  It charges whenever the main power switch is turned on.

The sub-battery contains cadmium that can be harmful to the environment.  When you dispose of the computer, you must remove the sub-battery.  Observe all local regulations regarding the locations and methods of disposing of the batteries.

For the detailed procedure of disposing of the sub-battery, see |Disposing of the Sub-Battery|Disposing of the Sub-Battery|.

You do not have to take care of the sub-battery under normal use.

The CONFIG.SYS file is important to the hard drive of the computer.  When the computer starts up, it reads the CONFIG.SYS file to make the hardware and memory settings.  The CONFIG.SYS file is a plain text file and set at the factory with the items listed below.

As you add accessories and application programs to the computer, their installers modify the CONFIG.SYS file and the contents of this file become unique to your computer.

Change the CONFIG.SYS file as little as possible.  Adding the other settings to the file is recommended more than changing or deleting directly.  Deleting lines from the CONFIG.SYS file may disable accessories or applications.

\bWhat does a Setup Utility Do?\b

The setup utilities are the functions that let you control the computer's startup, the built-in printer and special power control features.

The setup utilities are handy when you want to:

• Save power.  You can set the Suspended Mode to the computer.  The Suspended Mode leaves the main power on.  The computer remembers what you have been doing when you stop, so you can continue without interruption next time.

• Select a printer emulation.  You can use the built-in printer like another type of printer.

• Select printing options: bold, expanded or reduced character printing modes, or any one of the other printing options.

• Find the cause of printing problems, or run the Self-Test print pattern.

• Clean the print head.

• Change the hardware configuration when you add optional equipment for more convenient and powerful computing capabilities.

• Streamline your system for immediate startup.

• Specify a password to enable access to the computer.

There are two types of setup utilities:

|The Windows Setup Utility|The Windows Setup Utility|

|The Easy-Setup|The Easy-Setup|

\bNote:\b When your power control settings include the power-off of the hard disk, you will not be able to access the hard disk for a few moments after the power comes back on.  During this time, the hard disk speed stabilizes and the disk heads move to the proper position.

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

With the Windows Setup Utility, you can do the following:

• Stop using the computer for a while but leave the main power on. You can use the power control features to save power.  The computer remembers what you have been doing when you stop, so you can continue without interruption next time.

• Select a printer emulation.  You can use the built-in printer like another type of printer.

• Select bold, expanded, or reduced character printing modes, or any one of the other printing options.

• Find the cause of printing problems, or run the Self-Test print pattern.

• Clean the print head.

There are two setup utilities you can use from Windows.  To run one of these utilities, click on the highlighted name of the utility.

	|The Built-in Printer Setup Utility|!run c:\canon\others\bnprset.exe|

[Installation Notes]
Reinstalling Your System
5

\bMake the Install Disks first, using the Backup Utility.\b
For reinstallation of the operating systems, you need to make the Install Disks by using the Backup Utility (CBACKUP.EXE) as the computer suggests initially on the display.  These disks return the computer to the original, factory-installed system configuration.  For instructions on making the Installation Disks, see the "Setup Guide".   

\bWhen you need to reinstall the operating systems:\b
Normally, when you turn on the main power switch, both the factory-installed MS-DOS and Windows operating systems start up automatically.  If the operating systems won't start up, you may need to reinstall them.  The following are possible situations for reinstalling the operating systems:  
	a) When you want to return the computer to the original shipping condition at the factory.
	b) When the computer (hardware) has stopped working for some reason.
	c) When certain programs (software) have stopped for some reason.
	d) When you add a driver such as a printer driver.

\bCopy the Install Disks onto the hard disk.\b
To install the operating systems, copy all the contents of the Install Disks you have backed up onto the hard disk.  The contents of the Installation Disks are:
	a) Microsoft MS-DOS 6 Setup Disks (3)
	b) Microsoft Windows 3.1 Setup Disks (7)
	c) System Utility Disks (5)
Be sure to follow the order of a), b) and c) for correct installation. 

\bIf the screen goes blank during installation, press Shift.\b
Depending on the Setup Utility settings you have made, the screen may go blank to save power while you are copying disks.  If this happens, press Shift immediately to return the display.  If the display won't return, however, slide the Suspend/Resume switch to the right for more than 1 second to restore it.

\b\mWhen you turn the main power switch on or slide the Suspend/Resume switch to restart the computer, both the Error/Stop lamp and Data lamp blink for approximately 3 seconds
and the beep sounds.\b\k
This indicates the waste ink is almost full at the tank but the computer is still usable.  But contact a Canon service facility to change an element of the built-in printer unit as soon as possible.

\b\mThe printer does not print properly.\b\k
This could be:
-The emulation mode the printer is set to and the application you are using may have different printer settings.
-The Windows printer driver may not be correctly selected.
-The program may not be sending data correctly.
Check the following:
-Verify the printer driver settings in your application program and in the Setup Utilities.  You can do this in the "Built-in Printer" of the Windows Setup Utility.  The emulation setting selection for your application program should look like this:

\b\mThe driver settings for each emulation selection\b\k
     -\bBuilt-in MBJ-20(X24E/BJ-130e) driver setting:\b X24E or BJ-130e emulation
     -\bBJ-10e or BJ-10ex, or BJ-5 driver setting:\b BJ-130e emulation
     -\bX24E driver setting:\b X24E emulation
     -\bLQ-510driver setting:\b LQ-510 emulation

\b\mThe application driver settings for each emulation selection\b\k
     -\bBJ-10ex or BJ-10e application driver:\b X24E
     -\bBJ-130e application driver:\b BJ-130e
     -\bX24E application driver:\b X24E
     -\bLQ-510 application driver:\b LQ-510

\bThe Built-in MBJ-20 (X24E/BJ-130e) Driver\b
This driver does not support the built-in printer fonts.  If you want to use the built-in printer fonts, select the Windows BJ-10e, BJ-10ex or BJ-5 driver.
This driver is designed for high speed printing using TrueType fonts and images frequently used in Windows.  However, with the application programs such as NotePad, which print using the printer fonts, the BJ-10e, BJ-10ex or BJ-5 driver requires less time to print.
The available fonts are indicated by icons on the left of the font name in application programs such as Windows Write, which use dialog boxes for font selection.  The fonts displayed with a printer icon are printer fonts, and those with TT are TrueType fonts and all other fonts are Windows bit-mapped fonts.
-Select a printer driver for Windows from the Control Panel Printer settings.
-The data sent to the printer can be printed in hexadecimal code to verify that the program is sending data correctly.  This is called the "hexadecimal dump mode".  To set the printer to the hexadecimal dump mode, do the following:
Insert a letter-size or A4-size sheet of paper.  While pressing and holding the Stop/Restart button plus the Feed button, turn the Printer switch on.  When you hear a series of double beeps, remove your fingers.  To exit the printer from hexadecimal dump mode, turn the Printer switch off.

The most important point to make with Battery lamp messages is whether or not you need to connect the AC adapter to your computer.

\bThe Battery lamp is blinking\b:  If the AC adapter is not used and battery power is critical, the Battery lamp is blinking in \morange\k.

If you are using the computer while the Battery lamp is blinking, connect the AC adapter to the computer.

\bThe Battery lamp is on \g(green):\k\b  The battery is in use and it has plenty of power remaining.  No response is necessary.


\bThe lamp is on\y (yellow):\k\b  The battery is in use but its power is starting to run low.  No response is necessary.


\bThe lamp is on \m(orange):\k\b  The battery is in use but it has only a little power remaining.  Save the data to the hard disk as soon as possible.  If you continue your work, connect the AC adapter.  After your work is finished, be sure to charge the battery.  You may lose the data or the resume function may not work normally unless you save the data or connect the AC adapter.

If the error occurs during the charging process, activate the Suspend/Resume switch to stop charging.  Wait until the battery temperature returns to the room temperature, then repeat the charging process.

If the Charge lamp still blinks, there may be a failure in the battery.  Be sure to remove the battery you are using and connect the AC adapter or a new battery.


\bThe Charge lamp is blinking and the Battery Lamp is \yyellow\k:\b  Trickle charge is being done due to the low-battery voltage.

If the error occurs during the charging process, activate the Suspend/Resume switch to stop charging.  Wait until the battery temperature returns to the room temperature, then repeat the charging process.

\bThe Charge lamp is on and Battery Lamp is \yyellow\k:\b  The rapid charge process is proceeding properly.  No response is necessary.

\bThe Charge lamp is on and the Battery Lamp is \morange\k:\b  The battery may be bad; imbalanced electric current has been detected.  If the error has occurred during charging, activate the Suspend/Resume switch and save the data.  Then connect the AC adapter, turn the main power switch off and on, and repeat the charging process.

If the Battery lamp is still \morange\k, there may be a failure in the battery.  Remove the battery you are using and connect the AC adapter or a new battery.

/RAM
Random Access Memory. Internal memory that is used for temporary storage of programs and data.  When the computer is turned off, the contents of RAM are lost.

/ROM
Read Only Memory.  Internal memory that contains pre-defined programs and data.  You cannot modify this memory.  When the printer or computer is turned off, ROM memory remains intact. In this printer, the default settings and the resident fonts are stored in ROM.

/Scrolling
Scrolling refers to moving the characters or graphics on the screen up, down, right, or left.  Imagine that the characters or graphics are on a paper scroll and you can look at part of the scroll at a time through a window.  Scrolling means moving the window to see a different part of the scroll.  Thus, scrolling down means moving your window, or viewpoint, down to see more information.

/SIMM
Single In-line Memory Module.  A SIMM consists of a compact array of memory chips mounted in a straight line on a circuit board.  SIMMs can be installed in your computer to increase its memory capacity.
